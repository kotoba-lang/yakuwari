  "役割 — a durable organizational role.

  A yakuwari decides WHAT to do (self-judgement) but cannot rewrite its own
  definition (no self-evolution). That single asymmetry is the reason it
  needs no lease: a human who reviewed this spec once stays correct,
  because the thing they approved cannot change underneath them. Only the
  AO above it — which does rewrite itself — needs a temporal re-consent
  point.

  Its identity describes **responsibility, not implementation**:
  `issue-scout`, `independent-reviewer`, `panel-steward`. Runner names
  (`codex`, `claude`, `grok`) are execution attributes and must never be
  used as yakuwari identity — that collapse is what tamaki ADR-0001 was
  written to stop.

  Extracted from `kotoba.tamaki.actor` (ADR-0001). Named `yakuwari` rather
  than `actor` because that word is already taken three times over: the
  Hewitt concurrency primitive (`kotoba-lang/actor-ipc`), the wasmCloud-style
  deployment unit on murakumo, and this. Three collisions is not a naming
  preference.

  Pure and portable — no clock, no storage, no dispatch."

(defn capabilities->policy
  "The authored `:yakuwari/capabilities` form -> the `{capability decision}`
  map `yakuwari.policy` consumes.

  Two spellings of the same thing exist because they are good at different
  jobs. A flat `{cap decision}` map is what the policy functions want. But a
  reviewer needs to know *why* a capability was granted, and the reason is
  the part worth reviewing — so a role file authors a vector of
  `{:capability :decision :note}`, keeping the justification next to the
  grant instead of in a comment that drifts away from it.

  Nothing joined the two, which is how a reviewed policy came to have no
  effect: `person-awai-ryo` declared `:mail.inbound :autonomous` and
  `decide` answered `:blocked`, because an absent `:yakuwari/policy` is a
  valid empty map and validation had no reason to complain. It failed
  closed, so nothing was over-permitted — but the file a human approved was
  not the file the model read.

  A capability listed twice takes the STRICTEST of its decisions
  (`policy/strictest-of`), the same rule that already applies to a
  capability reachable by more than one path. Duplicates are a drafting
  mistake, and resolving one toward autonomy would let a careless second
  entry widen a reviewed grant."
